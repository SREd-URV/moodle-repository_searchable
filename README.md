# Searchable Moodle repository

A filesystem-based repository focused on searchable capabilities, ideal for
directories with lots (thousands) of files.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or unzip the archive into repository/searchable.
1. Go to Site Administration -> Notifications to install it.

## Set up

1. Go to Site Administration -> Plugins -> Repositories -> Searchable filesystem to:
 1. Set up this repository and user capabilities.
 1. Build instances of searchable repositories pointing to subdirectories under
 MOODLEDATA/repository/. They must not be links.

## About this repository

We build course backups from Moodle courses, with thousands of backup files.
When trying to mount the directory as a filesystem repository instance,
it never ended.

Since we simply needed to pick up some file at a time, we thought on building
a repository instance, based on server-side filesystem with searchable
capabilities. It may be extensible to users if administrators want to, too.

To do so, we based this repository on the current filesystem repository from
the Moodle core, and the ideas behind other searchable repositories.
